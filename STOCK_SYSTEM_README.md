# POS System - Stock Management System

This document outlines the stock management system in the POS application and provides details about the fixes implemented to address issues with real-time stock updates.

## Stock Management Overview

The stock management system tracks inventory levels for all products and records changes through:

1. **Product Stock Values**: Each product has a `stock` field that represents the current quantity available.
2. **Stock Movements**: All changes to stock are recorded in the `stock_movement` table, which tracks:
   - Product ID
   - Quantity
   - Movement type (sale or restock)
   - Remaining stock after the movement
   - Timestamp
   - Notes (optional)

## Issues Addressed

The following issues were identified and fixed in the stock management system:

### 1. Stock Consistency Issues

**Issue**: In some cases, the product stock values weren't consistent with the accumulated stock movements.

**Fix**: 
- `fix_stock_updates.py` script checks for and fixes inconsistencies between the product stock values and the calculated values based on movement history.
- Additional validation was added to prevent negative stock values.

### 2. UI Refresh Issues

**Issue**: The UI didn't always reflect the most recent stock values, and updates were sometimes delayed or required a manual page refresh.

**Fix**:
- `improve_stock_refresh.py` script enhances the stock refresh functionality in the frontend code:
  - Added cache-busting headers to force fresh data retrieval
  - Improved auto-refresh mechanism across pages
  - Added explicit refresh buttons on key pages
  - Enhanced error handling for network failures

### 3. Transaction Handling

**Issue**: Some stock updates weren't properly committed to the database, leading to inconsistent state.

**Fix**:
- The `update_stock` method in the Product model was improved to include explicit transaction handling, with proper commits and rollbacks.
- Additional logging was added to track stock update operations.

## Testing

The improvements can be tested using:

1. **Stock Consistency Check**:
   ```
   python fix_stock_updates.py
   ```
   This checks and fixes any inconsistencies between product stock values and stock movement history.

2. **UI Refresh Testing**:
   ```
   python test_stock_update.py
   ```
   This creates a test product and runs a simulation of stock updates to verify that changes appear in real-time in the UI.

## Key Components

### Backend

- **Product.update_stock()**: The central method for updating product stock, found in `app.py`.
- **stock_status API endpoint**: Returns fresh stock data directly from the database, bypassing any caching.
- **Stock movement records**: Created for every stock change to maintain an audit trail.

### Frontend

- **refreshStock() function**: JavaScript function in `app.js` that fetches the latest stock data.
- **updateProductStockUI() function**: Updates the UI elements to display current stock levels.
- **Auto-refresh mechanism**: Periodically refreshes stock data without requiring user interaction.
- **Force refresh button**: Allows users to manually trigger a stock refresh when needed.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the update_stock method** to change product stock levels - don't update the stock field directly.
2. **Check stock availability** before finalizing sales to prevent negative stock.
3. **Include meaningful notes** in stock movement records to maintain a clear audit trail.
4. **Regularly verify** stock levels against physical inventory.

## Troubleshooting

If stock updates aren't appearing in real-time:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors.
2. Verify that the stock_status API is returning the expected data.
3. Try clicking the Force Refresh button on the page.
4. If needed, restart the Flask application to clear any server-side caching.
5. Run `fix_stock_updates.py` to check for and fix any stock inconsistencies.
